# Scaling up Allee effects from populations to metapopulations
#### Kaustubh V. Kulkarni, Jonas Wickman, Christopher A. Klausmeier and Thomas Koffel

Code accompanying the article "Scaling up Allee effects from populations to metapopulations"

### Instructions:
- The folder `code` contains a Jupyter notebook titled `code.ipynb` with the Python code to reproduce the results
- On running the code from the Jupyter notebook, the created plots are saved in the `figures` folder
- For analyses that take a long time to run, the produced numerical results are stored in the `data` folder
- Further instructions can be found in the Jupyter notebook

The code requires the following Python libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`. Creating the animations requires `FFmpeg`. The code was run using `Python 3.13.0`, `numpy 2.1.2`, `scipy 1.14.1`, `pandas 2.2.3 `, `matplotlib 3.9.2`, and `FFmpeg version 2025-04-23-git-25b0a8e295-full_build-www.gyan.dev`.
